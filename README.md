# feed_finder

Extracts RSS/Atom feed links from a website.

Supports both explicit feeds in `<link>` tags, or links mentioned in the `<body>`.

Inspired and initially modelled after [python-3-feedfinder-rss-detection-from-url](https://alex.miller.im/posts/python-3-feedfinder-rss-detection-from-url/).
