# feed_finder

(Forked from the original [feedfinder](https://github.com/marcjoha/feed_finder), which hasn't been updated in a while.)

Extracts RSS/Atom feed links from a website.

Supports both explicit feeds in `<link>` tags, or links mentioned in the `<body>`.

Inspired and initially modelled after [python-3-feedfinder-rss-detection-from-url](https://alex.miller.im/posts/python-3-feedfinder-rss-detection-from-url/).
